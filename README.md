# Supermarket pricing exercise

Model a supermarket pricing calculator inspired by [PragDaveâ€™s Supermarket Kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/).

This currently just allows generating receipt items for a basket of goods, without applying discounts.
It's laid out as a set of java classes, with junit tests to verify the model.

To run tests and verify the model run `mvn test`

Requires java 17 and maven.
